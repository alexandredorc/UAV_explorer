# UAV_explorer

Final year project: Optimising autonomous exploration strategies for flying drones using 3D perception.
This project, based on the Subterranean DARPA challenge, aims to use 3D data obtained during exploration to optimise exploration missions in unknown environments, using a genetic algorithm model.
